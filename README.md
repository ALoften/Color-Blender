# Color-Blender
Blending css colors from clicked html DOM objects using JS.

I made this to teach a Dev underling how to be creative in his code designs. Ofcourse the version I gave him does not have the JS, thats his job to figure that out.

This project passes colors using the style tag to the css page as variables where it is inserted into the background as an rgb. Then the js will grab the background-color variable and will reapply it as a background after gettign the average of two values(the new color mixed with the old color divided by 2).

Easy peasy! Keep in mind, it is impossible to get back to black(I think. But you can get close...), and it blends the colors. So if you click green and say "thats not the shade I clicked!", it is, but its been blended. :)
